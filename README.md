## Tests
All ViewModels have tests that cover the business logic.

There are automated UI tests that verify the most user intansive screens

*Note: All tests HAVE to be ran on a REAL device as there are problems with the current version with Jetpack Compose and the testing library. These bugs should be fixed in the next release of the libraries.

## Security
Security is a top priority. The application communicates to the REST API via HTTPS. When a user selects to be remembered in the device, their login credentials are saved in encrypted shared preferences.
